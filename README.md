## üìå Objective

Design and build a basic Employee Compensation Forecasting Application for HR and business stakeholders. This Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates real-world HR analytics features, including compensation simulations and workforce distribution analysis.


## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

- **Backend Database**: SQL Server (or any relational database)
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Framework**: Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Optional)
- **Libraries**: `pandas`, `flask`, 

## üìÇ Dataset

- Excel file containing sample employee data.
- Fields include: Employee Name, Role, Location, Experience, Compensation, Status.

## ‚úÖ User Stories

1. **Filter and Display Active Employees by Role**:  
   - Filter by role, view average compensation by location, bar chart of compensation, toggle active/inactive.

2. **Group Employees by Years of Experience**:  
   - View count by experience ranges, group by location/role.

3. **Simulate Compensation Increments**:  
   - Input global increment and view updated compensation.

4. **Download Filtered Employee Data**:  
   - Export filtered data as CSV, reflecting any increments applied.
